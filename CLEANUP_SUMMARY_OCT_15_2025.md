## 🔧 Configuration Issues Identified & Fixed

### Critical Issue 1: Wrong Backend URL in Documentation ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Multiple documentation files showed wrong backend URL
- Documentation said: `https://backend-554106646136.europe-west1.run.app`
- Actual URL: `https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app`
- **Result:** Frontend deployed with wrong URL, no data loading

**Solution:**
- ✅ All documentation updated with correct URLs
- ✅ `frontend/.env.production` verified and corrected
- ✅ Configuration validation checklist created

### Critical Issue 2: Database Connection Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Backend using TCP connection instead of Unix socket
- Wrong: `DB_HOST=35.202.149.98` (TCP)
- Correct: `DB_HOST=/cloudsql/helloliam:us-central1:hiking-db` (Unix socket)
- **Result:** Cloud Run couldn't connect to database (timeout errors)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Deployment documentation explicitly shows correct DB_HOST
- ✅ Configuration guide explains Unix socket vs TCP
- ✅ Pre-deployment checklist verifies DB_HOST configuration

### Critical Issue 3: Pagination Backend Limit ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Backend API defaulted to `limit=10`, frontend didn't specify limit
- **Result:** Only 10 of 12 users displaying

**Solution:**
- ✅ Frontend API call now includes `?limit=1000`
- ✅ Pagination implemented in UI
- ✅ Deployed and verified working

### Issue 4: .env.local Overriding Production Builds
**Problem:** Developers might have `.env.local` during production build
- **Result:** Wrong configuration embedded in production build

**Solution:**
- ✅ Pre-deployment checklist checks for `.env.local`
- ✅ Configuration guide explains file precedence
- ✅ Documentation shows how to disable `.env.local`

## ✅ Best Practices Established

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist (Mandatory)
**Rule:** Never deploy without completing [PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

**Checklist covers:**
- Code and dependencies verification
- Frontend configuration verification (critical!)
- Backend configuration verification (critical!)
- Database connectivity checks
- Pre-deployment testing
- Post-deployment verification

### 2. Single Source of Truth
**Rule:** All deployment info in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

**No more:**
- Scattered deployment instructions
- Conflicting documentation
- Outdated guides
- Wrong URLs

### 3. Configuration Reference
**Rule:** All environment variables documented in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)

**Includes:**
- Every environment variable explained
- Production vs development settings
- Common mistakes documented
- Validation commands provided

### 4. Version Control
**Rule:** Always commit configuration changes

```bash
# Good practice
git add frontend/.env.production
git commit -m "fix: update backend URL in frontend config"
git push
```

### 5. Verification Steps
**Rule:** Always verify deployment success

**Immediate checks:**
- Backend health endpoint
- Frontend loads without errors
- API endpoints respond correctly
- No errors in logs

DB_PORT=5432  ✅ CORRECT
NODE_ENV=production  ✅ CORRECT
```

**Cloud SQL Connection:** `--add-cloudsql-instances=helloliam:us-central1:hiking-db`  ✅ CORRECT

**Status:** ✅ Verified and deployed
