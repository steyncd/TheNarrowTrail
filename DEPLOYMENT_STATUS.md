## ⏳ Backend Deployment - ACTION REQUIRED

### Backend Status
**Status**: ⚠️ **Needs Manual Deployment**

The backend has been completely refactored but needs to be deployed to Google Cloud Run.

### What's Ready
- ✅ Refactored backend (20 modular files)
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Tested and validated
- ✅ Build successful

### Backend Files

└── server.js                 ✅ Ready (80 lines!)
```

### Deployment Instructions

**You need to deploy the backend manually using Cloud Run CLI or Console.**

**Important Note**: As per your previous instructions, I won't attempt backend deployments. Please deploy manually when ready.

### Deployment Checklist
```bash
# 1. Ensure you're in the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Deploy to Cloud Run (you'll do this manually)
# Your usual deployment command here

# 3. Verify deployment
# Test health endpoint: https://hiking-portal-api-554106646136.us-central1.run.app/health
```

### Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Cloud Run:
- `DB_HOST` - Database host (Cloud SQL socket or IP)
- `DB_USER` - Database user
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `DB_NAME` - Database name
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret key
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - SendGrid API key (optional)
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` - From email address (optional)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Twilio SID (optional)
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Twilio token (optional)
- `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` - WhatsApp number (optional)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`

### No Code Changes Needed
The refactored backend maintains 100% backward compatibility:
- ✅ All endpoints remain the same
- ✅ No API contract changes
- ✅ Same authentication flow
- ✅ Same database queries
- ✅ Drop-in replacement

## 📊 Database Migrations - OPTIONAL

### Migration Status
**Status**: ⚠️ **Optional - For BOOKED Banners Feature**

### Available Migration
**File**: `backend/migrations/001_add_hike_attendance.sql`

**Purpose**: Creates `hike_attendance` table for user self-service attendance confirmation (the "BOOKED!" banner feature).

**What it does**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hike_attendance (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    hike_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES hikes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    confirmed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT,
    UNIQUE(hike_id, user_id)
);
```

### When to Run This Migration

**Run this migration if**:
- You want users to self-confirm attendance (shows "BOOKED!" banner)
- You want to track attendance separately from payment

**Don't run if**:
- You only want admin-managed attendance (via `hike_attendees` table)
- You're not using the attendance confirmation feature yet

### How to Run Migration

```bash
# Option 1: Via psql command line
psql -h <db-host> -U <db-user> -d hiking_portal -f backend/migrations/001_add_hike_attendance.sql

# Option 2: Via Cloud SQL proxy
# First start proxy, then:
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <db-user> -d hiking_portal -f backend/migrations/001_add_hike_attendance.sql

# Option 3: Via Cloud Console
# Copy SQL from file and run in Cloud SQL Query Editor
```

### Migration Impact
- ✅ **Safe to run**: Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- ✅ **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times safely
- ✅ **No data loss**: Only creates new table
- ✅ **No downtime**: Non-blocking operation
- ✅ **Rollback safe**: Can drop table if needed

### Features Affected
If you DON'T run this migration:
- User self-service attendance confirmation won't work
- "BOOKED!" banners won't appear (will show interest instead)
- Everything else works normally

If you DO run this migration:
- Users can confirm their own attendance
- "BOOKED!" banners appear on confirmed hikes
- Better attendance tracking
- Separate from payment status
