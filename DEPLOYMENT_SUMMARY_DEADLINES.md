## Visual Design System

### Color Scheme
- **Red (#dc3545)**: Registration closed, danger state
- **Yellow (#ffc107)**: Warning, closing soon, due soon
- **Green (#198754)**: Open for registration, success state
- **Blue (#0d6efd)**: Informational, payment info

### Icons (lucide-react)
- **XCircle**: Registration closed
- **AlertCircle**: Warning/closing soon
- **CheckCircle**: Open/available
- **Clock**: Deadline/time-related
- **DollarSign**: Payment-related
- **Info**: Informational messages

### UI Components
1. **Corner Ribbons**: 45¬∞ rotated banners in top-right corner
2. **Alert Banners**: Large prominent alerts at page top
3. **Deadline Cards**: Bordered cards with color-coded status
4. **Status Badges**: Small pills showing "Closed", "Closing Soon", "Due Soon"
5. **Disabled Buttons**: Grayed out with explanatory text

---

## Business Logic

### Registration Closed Determination
```javascript
isRegistrationClosed = hike.registration_closed ||
  (hike.registration_deadline && new Date(hike.registration_deadline) < new Date())
```
Event is closed if:
- Manual `registration_closed` flag is true, OR
- `registration_deadline` has passed

### Warning Thresholds
- **Registration Closing Soon**: 7 days before registration deadline
- **Payment Due Soon**: 7 days before payment deadline

### User Permissions
- **Logged Out Users**: Cannot express interest (must log in)
- **Logged In Users**: Can express interest if registration open
- **Users with Existing Interest**: Can still view event details when closed
- **Admin Users**: Can set deadlines and manually close registration

---

## Testing Performed

## Known Limitations

### Not Yet Implemented
1. **Automated Payment Reminder Emails**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Description: Scheduled job to send reminder emails to unpaid attendees
   - Priority: Optional enhancement
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

2. **Email Notifications for Registration Closure**
   - Status: Not implemented
