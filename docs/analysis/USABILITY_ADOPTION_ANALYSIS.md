## Priority Recommendations

### üî• CRITICAL (Immediate Impact)

#### 1. **Streamlined Onboarding Flow**
**Problem**: Current flow creates 2-3 day delay (email verification + admin approval)
**Impact**: High abandonment risk for new users
**Solution**:
```
Current:  Sign Up ‚Üí Email Verify ‚Üí Wait for Admin ‚Üí Start Using
Proposed: Sign Up ‚Üí Email Verify ‚Üí Instant Access (with limited permissions)
          ‚Üí Background verification ‚Üí Full access granted
```
**Implementation**:
- Auto-approve users with verified emails
- Grant "provisional" access to browse and express interest
- Require full approval before confirming attendance
- Add progressive profile completion prompts
- **Estimated Impact**: 40-60% reduction in sign-up abandonment

#### 2. **Welcome Tour & Interactive Onboarding**
**Problem**: New users don't know where to start or what features exist
**Solution**:

**Solution**:
