## Summary

Reorganized all project documentation into a logical, topic-based structure for better maintainability and discoverability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Directory Structure

```

├── mobile/              # Mobile responsiveness (6 files)
├── notifications/       # Notification system (7 files)
├── performance/         # Performance optimization (2 files)
├── development/         # Dev guides (existing)
├── deployment/          # Deployment guides (existing)

3. **Maintainability**: Related documentation kept together
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new documentation to appropriate category
5. **Professional**: Well-organized structure reflects project maturity

## File Count Summary

- **Root**: 1 file (README.md only)
- **Compliance**: 7 files
- **Features**: 13 files
- **Mobile**: 6 files
- **Notifications**: 7 files
- **Performance**: 2 files
- **Development**: Existing files retained
- **Deployment**: Existing files retained
- **Archive**: Existing files retained

## Next Steps

1. Consider archiving older deployment summaries after review
2. Periodically review and update documentation
3. Consider adding version numbers to major feature docs
4. Create video tutorials for key features

## Notes

- All original files preserved in their new locations
- No content was deleted, only moved
