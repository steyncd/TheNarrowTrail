    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('token') }
  }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
  ```

## üìù Testing Notes

### Known Limitations
- Permission changes require re-login (by design)
- Frontend caches permissions on login
- Backend is source of truth for permissions

### Performance Notes
- Permission checks are synchronous (fast)
- No noticeable lag in navigation
- Role modal loads quickly (< 500ms)

### Browser Compatibility
- Tested on: Chrome, Edge (Chromium)
- Should work on: Firefox, Safari
- IE11: Not supported (uses modern React)
