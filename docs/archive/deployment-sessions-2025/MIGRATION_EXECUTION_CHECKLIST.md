## Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Environment Preparation
- [ ] Verify you're in the correct environment (test/staging/production)
- [ ] Confirm database connection is working
- [ ] Check current database user has necessary permissions (CREATE, ALTER, INSERT)
- [ ] Note current database size for comparison
- [ ] Verify Node.js version (v18+ required)

### 2. Backup
```bash
# Create database backup
pg_dump -U <username> -h <host> -d <database> -F c -b -v -f "backup_pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump"

# Verify backup was created
ls -lh backup_pre_migration_*.dump
```

- [ ] Database backup created successfully
- [ ] Backup file size is reasonable (not 0 bytes)
- [ ] Backup stored in safe location
- [ ] Backup verified (can be restored if needed)

### 3. Test Checklist
- [x] All 57 automated tests passing
- [x] Migration files validated
- [x] Routes and controllers verified
- [x] Documentation complete

---

## Migration Execution

### Step 1: Navigate to Backend
```bash
cd backend
pwd  # Verify you're in /backend directory
```
- [ ] In correct directory

### Step 2: Run Index Migration (018)
```bash
# Run the index migration
node run-migration.js 018_add_user_management_indexes.sql

# Expected output: "Migration 018_add_user_management_indexes.sql executed successfully"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates 6 performance indexes on users table
- Runs ANALYZE for updated statistics
- No data changes, only performance improvements

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check indexes were created
SELECT indexname, tablename 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'users' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_users_%';

-- Should show 6 new indexes:
-- idx_users_name
-- idx_users_created_at
-- idx_users_status_role
-- idx_users_email_verified
-- idx_users_consent_status
-- idx_users_search_text
```

- [ ] Migration completed without errors
- [ ] All 6 indexes created
- [ ] ANALYZE completed

### Step 3: Test Application After Index Migration
```bash
# Start the server (in another terminal)
npm start

# Test that application still works
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Can log in as admin
- [ ] Can view user list

### Step 4: Run Permission System Migration (017)
```bash
# Run the permission system migration
node run-migration.js 017_create_permission_system.sql

# Expected output: "Migration 017_create_permission_system.sql executed successfully"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates 4 new tables (permissions, roles, role_permissions, user_roles)
- Inserts 35+ permissions
- Creates 4 default roles
- Migrates all existing users to new role system
- Creates 6 indexes on permission tables
- Creates 2 helper views

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('permissions', 'roles', 'role_permissions', 'user_roles');

-- Check permissions were inserted
SELECT category, COUNT(*) 
FROM permissions 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY category;

-- Check roles were created
SELECT name, is_system 
FROM roles 
ORDER BY name;

-- Check users were migrated
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE status = 'approved') as total_users,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM user_roles) as migrated_users;
-- These numbers should match

-- Check admin has all permissions
SELECT COUNT(*) as admin_permissions
FROM roles r
JOIN role_permissions rp ON r.id = rp.role_id
WHERE r.name = 'admin';
-- Should show 35+

-- Check views were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('role_permissions_view', 'user_permissions_view');
```

- [ ] Migration completed without errors
- [ ] All 4 tables created
- [ ] 35+ permissions inserted (check by category)
- [ ] 4 roles created (admin, hiker, guide, moderator)
- [ ] All users migrated to user_roles table
- [ ] 6 indexes created on permission tables
- [ ] 2 views created
- [ ] Admin role has all permissions

### Step 5: Restart Application
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in server terminal)

# Start the server again
npm start

# Check for any startup errors
```

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] No permission-related error messages
- [ ] Routes loaded successfully

## Post-Migration Testing

### API Endpoint Tests

#### 1. Test Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```
- [ ] Returns 200 OK

#### 2. Test Login (Get Token)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"your-password"}'

# Save the token from response
TOKEN="<your-token-here>"
```
- [ ] Login successful
- [ ] Token received

#### 3. Test User Permissions Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/permissions/user/permissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
- [ ] Returns permissions array
- [ ] Admin user has 35+ permissions
- [ ] Returns roles array

#### 4. Test Get All Permissions
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/permissions/permissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
- [ ] Returns 35+ permissions
- [ ] Grouped by category

#### 5. Test Get All Roles
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/permissions/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
- [ ] Returns 4 roles
- [ ] Shows user counts
- [ ] Shows permission counts

#### 6. Test Paginated User List
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/users?page=1&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
- [ ] Returns 5 users (or less if fewer exist)
- [ ] Includes pagination metadata (totalUsers, totalPages, hasMore)
- [ ] Page loads quickly (<100ms)

#### 7. Test Advanced Search
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/users?search=john&role=hiker" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
- [ ] Returns filtered results
- [ ] Search works correctly
- [ ] Role filter works correctly

#### 8. Test Permission Blocking
```bash
# Try to access admin endpoint without admin permissions
# (Login as non-admin user first)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NON_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Error message indicates insufficient permissions

## Performance Verification

### Query Performance Tests

```sql
-- Test user list query with pagination
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, name, email, phone, role, created_at
FROM users
WHERE status = 'approved'
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;

-- Should show:
-- - Index Scan using idx_users_name (not Seq Scan)
-- - Execution time < 5ms
```

- [ ] Query uses index
- [ ] Execution time < 5ms
- [ ] No sequential scans

```sql
-- Test search query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
WHERE status = 'approved'
  AND (name ILIKE '%john%' OR email ILIKE '%john%')
LIMIT 10;

-- Should show faster than before
```

- [ ] Query completes quickly
- [ ] Uses appropriate indexes

```sql
-- Test permission lookup
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT DISTINCT p.name
FROM user_roles ur
JOIN role_permissions rp ON ur.role_id = rp.role_id
JOIN permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.id
WHERE ur.user_id = 1;

-- Should show:
-- - Index scans (not Seq Scan)
-- - Execution time < 5ms
```

- [ ] Permission lookup uses indexes
- [ ] Execution time < 5ms

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

### If Issues Are Found

```sql
-- Rollback permission system (order matters!)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_permissions_view;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS role_permissions_view;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_roles CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS role_permissions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS roles CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS permissions CASCADE;

-- Rollback indexes (optional, won't hurt to keep them)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_search_text;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_consent_status;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_email_verified;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_status_role;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_created_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_name;

-- Restart server
-- The old role system (VARCHAR) is still intact
```

- [ ] Rollback completed if needed
- [ ] Server restarted
- [ ] Application working with old system
