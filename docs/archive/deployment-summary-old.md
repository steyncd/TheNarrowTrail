## 📋 What Still Needs to Be Done

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Deploy Backend** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Backend deployment failed due to gcloud/Python issue
   - See `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for manual deployment options
   - Without backend deployment, email verification won't work

2. **Run Database Migration** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Run updated `schema.sql` on production database
   - Script is idempotent and safe to run multiple times
   - Adds all new fields and tables

3. **Test Email Verification** 📧
   - Register new test user
   - Check email for verification link
   - Click link and verify success
   - Check that admin can approve after verification

### Future Features (Documented in BACKEND_ADDITIONS.md):

4. **Hike Comments System** 💬
   - View, add, delete comments on hikes
   - Build community discussion

5. **Carpooling Coordination** 🚗
   - Offer rides with departure location, seats, time
   - Request rides with pickup location
   - See all offers/requests per hike

6. **Packing Lists** 🎒
   - Default lists based on hike type (day/multi-day)
   - Customizable per user per hike
   - Checkbox system to track packed items

7. **My Hikes Dashboard** 📊
   - Personal view of interested hikes
   - Confirmed attendance with payment status
   - Past hikes attended
   - Statistics (total hikes, multi-day count)

8. **Emergency Contacts** 🆘
   - Users add emergency contact info
   - Admins can view for attendees
   - Medical info field for allergies/conditions

9. **Multi-Day Hike Enhancements** 🏔️
   - Daily distance breakdown (JSON array)
   - Overnight facility descriptions
   - Image URL for destination
   - Website link for more info

10. **Achievement System** 🏆
    - Track milestones (1st hike, 10th hike, 50th hike)
    - Badge system
    - Celebrate user accomplishments
