# POPIA Compliance Implementation - Complete Summary

## Overview
Full implementation of POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act) compliance for the hiking portal, including consent management, user rights (deletion, data portability), and admin oversight.

---

## 1. Frontend Changes

### A. Legal Documentation Pages
**Created: `frontend/src/components/legal/PrivacyPolicy.js`**
- Comprehensive POPIA-compliant privacy policy
- Details data collection, usage, storage, and security
- Explains user rights (access, correction, deletion, portability, objection)
- Lists retention policies and third-party services
- Accessible at: `https://helloliam.web.app/privacy-policy`

**Created: `frontend/src/components/legal/TermsAndConditions.js`**
- Terms of service with hiking-specific liability clauses
- Membership rules and code of conduct
- Payment and cancellation policies
- Indemnification and limitation of liability
- Accessible at: `https://helloliam.web.app/terms`

### B. Registration Consent Collection
**Modified: `frontend/src/components/auth/SignUpForm.js`**
- Added 3 mandatory consent checkboxes:
  1. Terms & Conditions acceptance
  2. Privacy Policy acceptance
  3. Data processing consent for events/communications
- Links to full legal documents in checkboxes
- Validation prevents registration without all consents
- Visual consent section with proper styling

### C. User Data Management Components

**Created: `frontend/src/components/profile/DataExport.js`**
- Button to export complete user data as JSON
- Calls `GET /api/profile/export/data`
- Downloads file: `my-data-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Lists all exported data categories
- POPIA Right to Portability implementation

**Created: `frontend/src/components/profile/AccountDeletion.js`**
- 2-step account deletion process:
  1. Warning page showing what will be deleted
  2. Confirmation page requiring exact text match + password
- Lists 8 data categories that will be deleted:
  - User profile and account
  - Hike interest records
  - Attendance records  
  - Emergency contacts
  - Payments
  - Photos
  - Comments
  - Feedback and suggestions
- Password verification for security
- Automatic logout after deletion
- POPIA Right to Deletion implementation

### D. Admin Consent Management Dashboard

**Created: `frontend/src/components/admin/ConsentManagement.js`**
- Statistics cards showing:
  - Total users
  - Users with all consents
  - Missing privacy consents
  - Missing terms consents
- Filterable user table (All / Complete / Incomplete)
- Each user shows:
  - Name, email, phone, role
  - Privacy consent status + date
  - Terms acceptance status + date
  - Data processing consent status + date
  - Registration date
  - Overall completion status badge
- CSV export functionality (`popia-consent-report-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)
- Color-coded consent indicators (green checkmarks, red X's)
- Information card explaining POPIA tracking

**Modified: `frontend/src/components/admin/UserManagement.js`**
- Added tab interface with 2 tabs:
  1. "Users" - existing user management (approvals, editing, etc.)
  2. "POPIA Consent" - new consent dashboard
- Tab switching shows/hides appropriate content
- Add User button only visible on Users tab
- Integrated ConsentManagement component

### E. Profile Page Integration

**Modified: `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.js`**
- Added Data Export section (shows for own profile only)
- Added Danger Zone section with Delete Account button
- Both sections in responsive 2-column grid
- Account deletion triggers modal
- Imports and integrates new components

### F. API Service Updates

**Modified: `frontend/src/services/api.js`**
- `getConsentStatus(token)` - Fetch consent data for admin dashboard
- `deleteAccount(password, token)` - Delete user account with password verification
- Data export handled directly in DataExport component

---

## 2. Backend Changes

### A. Database Migration

**Created: `backend/migrations/014_add_popia_compliance.sql`**

Adds 6 new columns to `users` table:
```sql
- privacy_consent_accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
- privacy_consent_date TIMESTAMPTZ
- terms_accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
- terms_accepted_date TIMESTAMPTZ  
- data_processing_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
- data_processing_consent_date TIMESTAMPTZ
```

**Retroactive Update:**
- Sets all existing users' consents to `TRUE`
- Uses `created_at` as the consent date (assumes implied consent from continued use)
- Ensures compliance for historical data

### B. Authentication Controller

**Modified: `backend/controllers/authController.js`**

**Function: `register()`**
- Updated INSERT query to save 3 consent fields with `NOW()` timestamps:
  ```javascript
  privacy_consent_accepted = true,
  privacy_consent_date = NOW(),
  terms_accepted = true,
  terms_accepted_date = NOW(),
  data_processing_consent = true,
  data_processing_consent_date = NOW()
  ```
- Validates that consents are provided by frontend
- Records exact timestamp when consent was given

### C. Profile Controller

**Modified: `backend/controllers/profileController.js`**

**New Function: `deleteAccount(req, res)`**
- Verifies password before deletion
- Uses transaction for data integrity
- Cascading deletes from 8 tables in order:
  1. `hike_interest` - user's hike sign-ups
  2. `hike_attendees` - attendance records
  3. `emergency_contacts` - emergency contact info
  4. `user_payments` - payment history
  5. `hike_photos` - uploaded photos
  6. `hike_comments` - comments on hikes
  7. `feedback` - feedback submissions
  8. `suggestions` - suggestions submitted
  9. `users` - finally delete user record
- Logs deletion with `logsController.logActivity()`
- Commits transaction or rolls back on error
- Returns success message

**New Function: `exportUserData(req, res)`**
- Queries 8 data categories:
  1. Profile (from `users` table)
  2. Hike participation (from `hike_interest`)
  3. Emergency contacts (from `emergency_contacts`)
  4. Payments (from `user_payments`)
  5. Photos (from `hike_photos`)
  6. Comments (from `hike_comments`)
  7. Feedback (from `feedback`)
  8. Suggestions (from `suggestions`)
- Returns complete JSON with all user data
- Implements POPIA Right to Portability

### D. Admin Controller

**Modified: `backend/controllers/adminController.js`**

**New Function: `getConsentStatus(req, res)`**
- Queries all approved users with consent fields:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, name, email, phone, role, created_at,
         privacy_consent_accepted, privacy_consent_date,
         terms_accepted, terms_accepted_date,
         data_processing_consent, data_processing_consent_date
  FROM users
  WHERE approval_status = 'approved'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  ```
- Calculates statistics:
  - `total_users` - total count
  - `all_consents` - users with all 3 consents
  - `missing_privacy` - users without privacy consent
  - `missing_terms` - users without terms consent
  - `missing_data_processing` - users without data processing consent
- Returns `{ users: [...], stats: {...} }`

### E. Route Updates

**Modified: `backend/routes/profile.js`**
```javascript
// New routes
router.get('/export/data', auth, profileController.exportUserData);
router.delete('/delete/account', auth, profileController.deleteAccount);
```

**Modified: `backend/routes/admin.js`**
```javascript
// New route
router.get('/consent-status', auth, adminController.getConsentStatus);
```

- Edit Profile modal on ProfilePage
- `PUT /api/profile` endpoint

### Right to Deletion (Erasure)
✅ **Implemented via:**
- AccountDeletion component with password verification
- `DELETE /api/profile/delete/account` endpoint
- Cascading deletes across all related tables

### Right to Data Portability
✅ **Implemented via:**
- DataExport component
- `GET /api/profile/export/data` endpoint
- JSON format for machine-readable data

### Right to Object
✅ **Implemented via:**
- Email notification preferences (existing feature)
- WhatsApp notification preferences (existing feature)

---

## 4. Consent Tracking

### Registration Flow
1. User fills out registration form
2. User checks 3 mandatory consent boxes:
   - "I agree to the Terms and Conditions"
   - "I agree to the Privacy Policy"
   - "I consent to data processing for events and communications"
3. Frontend validates all boxes are checked
4. Backend saves consents with timestamps:
   ```
   privacy_consent_accepted = true, privacy_consent_date = '2025-01-15 14:32:11'
   terms_accepted = true, terms_accepted_date = '2025-01-15 14:32:11'
   data_processing_consent = true, data_processing_consent_date = '2025-01-15 14:32:11'
   ```

### Admin Oversight
- Admin can view consent status dashboard at Users → POPIA Consent tab
- Statistics show compliance levels
- Can export consent report for auditing
- Identifies users with incomplete consents (historical users)
