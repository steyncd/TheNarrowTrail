## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (5 minutes)

```bash
# Connect to your PostgreSQL database
# Replace with your actual connection details

psql -h your-database-host \
     -U your-database-user \
     -d hiking_portal \
     -f backend/migrations/014_add_popia_compliance.sql

# Verify the migration
psql -h your-database-host -U your-database-user -d hiking_portal

# In psql:
\d users
# You should see the new columns:
# - privacy_consent_accepted
# - privacy_consent_date
# - terms_accepted
# - terms_accepted_date
# - data_processing_consent
# - data_processing_consent_date
```

**Expected Output:**
- Migration adds 6 new columns to `users` table
- All existing users get consents set to `TRUE` with their `created_at` as consent date

---

### Step 2: Backend Deployment (10 minutes)

```bash
cd backend

# Option A: Deploy to Google Cloud Run (your current setup)
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/backend

gcloud run deploy backend \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/backend \
  --platform managed \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated

# Option B: Use your existing deploy script
./deploy.sh

# Or on Windows:
deploy.bat
```

**Verify Backend Deployment:**
```bash
# Test the new endpoints
# 1. Test consent status endpoint (requires admin token)
curl -X GET https://backend-554106646136.europe-west1.run.app/api/admin/consent-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: JSON with users array and stats object

# 2. Test data export endpoint (requires user token)
curl -X GET https://backend-554106646136.europe-west1.run.app/api/profile/export/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_USER_TOKEN"

# Expected: JSON with profile and all user data
```

---

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment (10 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Wait for deployment to complete
```

**Verify Frontend Deployment:**

Visit these URLs to confirm:
1. https://helloliam.web.app/privacy-policy ‚úÖ

## Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check consent fields for all users
SELECT 
  name, 
  email,
  privacy_consent_accepted,
  privacy_consent_date,
  terms_accepted,
  terms_accepted_date,
  data_processing_consent,
  data_processing_consent_date,
  created_at
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Count users by consent completion
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_users,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE privacy_consent_accepted AND terms_accepted AND data_processing_consent) AS all_consents_given,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT privacy_consent_accepted) AS missing_privacy,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT terms_accepted) AS missing_terms,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT data_processing_consent) AS missing_data_processing
FROM users
WHERE approval_status = 'approved';
```

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Arise)

### If Backend Has Issues
```bash
# Revert to previous Cloud Run revision
gcloud run services update-traffic backend \
  --to-revisions=PREVIOUS_REVISION=100 \
  --region=europe-west1
```

### If Frontend Has Issues
```bash
# Firebase allows rollback via console:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Hosting
# 2. Find previous deployment
# 3. Click "Rollback"
```

### If Database Migration Has Issues
```sql
-- Rollback migration (removes consent columns)
BEGIN;

ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS privacy_consent_accepted;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS privacy_consent_date;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS terms_accepted;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS terms_accepted_date;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS data_processing_consent;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS data_processing_consent_date;

COMMIT;
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "getConsentStatus is not a function"
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue 2: Consent checkboxes not showing on signup
**Solution:** Verify frontend deployed correctly, check browser console for errors

### Issue 3: Account deletion fails with "Invalid password"
**Solution:** User entered wrong password, try again with correct password

### Issue 4: Data export returns empty JSON
**Solution:** Check backend logs, ensure user has data in database

### Issue 5: POPIA Consent tab not visible
**Solution:** Ensure user is logged in as admin, check role in database
