## Rationale

### Why These Files Were Removed:
- **Temporary tracking documents** - Created during optimization work, no longer needed
- **Superseded documentation** - Information consolidated into comprehensive docs
- **Completed task guides** - Migration and optimization work is complete
- **Duplicate information** - Multiple docs covering similar content

### Why These Files Were Kept:
- **Comprehensive references** - PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md and LAZY_LOADING_OPTIMIZATION.md contain all essential information
- **Long-term value** - Useful for understanding what was done and why
- **Original documentation** - README files that existed before optimization work

---

## Result

The documentation is now clean and organized:
- **11 temporary files removed** (9 root + 2 backend)
- **5 essential files retained** (3 root + 2 backend)
- **No code files affected** - All optimizations remain in place
- **No backup files left** - Cleanup verified

All performance optimizations remain active and working. The retained documentation provides complete information for future reference without clutter from temporary tracking files.
