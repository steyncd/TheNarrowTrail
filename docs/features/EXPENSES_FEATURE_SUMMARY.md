### Income (Attendee Payments)
- Who paid
- How much collected
- Outstanding payments
- Payment methods

### Expenses (Hike Costs)
- What was spent
- Category breakdown
- Who paid expenses
- Pending reimbursements

### Net Position
Calculate: Total Attendee Payments - Total Expenses = Net Profit/Loss

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE hike_expenses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  hike_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES hikes(id),
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  paid_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  payment_method VARCHAR(50),
  payment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  expense_date TIMESTAMP,

  notes TEXT,
  created_by INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
