# Landing Page Improvements

**Implementation Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview

Enhanced the landing page to provide better user experience for both logged-in and non-logged-in users, with comprehensive hike information displayed including group type, hike type, and cost.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Button Display Based on Login Status ✅

**Problem:** 
- Landing page showed "Login to Join" button for all users, even when logged in
- Logged-in users couldn't navigate directly to hike details from landing page
- Different button text was confusing ("Login to Join" vs "View Details")

**Solution:**
- Unified button to always show "View Details" for all users
- **Logged-in users**: Clicking navigates directly to hike details page
- **Non-logged-in users**: Clicking opens the login modal first
- Consistent user experience with single, clear call-to-action

**Code Implementation:**
```javascript
<div className="card-footer bg-light border-0">
  <button
    className="btn btn-primary btn-sm w-100"
    onClick={() => {
      if (currentUser) {
        navigate(`/hikes/${hike.id}`);
      } else {
        setShowLoginModal(true);
      }
    }}
  >
    View Details
  </button>
</div>
```

### 2. Enhanced Hike Details Display ✅

**Added Information:**

#### a) **Hike Type & Group Type Badges**
- **Hike Type:** "Day Hike" or "Multi-Day" (blue badge)
- **Group Type:** "Family" or "Men's" (gray badge)
- **Cost:** Displays cost in Rands (green badge) if > 0
  - Shows "~" symbol if price is an estimate
  - Tooltip shows "Estimated price" or "Confirmed price"
- Positioned prominently below description for quick identification

#### b) **Improved Date Display**
- **Before:** Short format (e.g., "Oct 9, 2025")
- **After:** Full format with weekday (e.g., "Thu, Oct 9, 2025")
- Shows "~" symbol if date is an estimate
- Tooltip shows "Estimated date" or "Confirmed date"

#### c) **Time Information**
- Added display of hike start time (if available)
- Clock icon with formatted time
- Only shows if `hike.time` exists

#### d) **Location Information**
- Added full location display (e.g., "Cradle of Humankind")
- Map pin icon with location name
- Text truncated with ellipsis if too long
- Only shows if `hike.location` exists

#### e) **Participant Counts**
- Shows number of interested participants
- Shows number of confirmed participants
- Visual badges with different colors:
  - **Blue badge** for interested count
  - **Green badge** for confirmed count
- Only displays when counts > 0

#### f) **Color-Coded Difficulty Badges**
- **Green badge** for "Easy" hikes
- **Yellow badge** for "Moderate" hikes
- **Red badge** for "Hard" hikes
- Provides instant visual difficulty recognition

#### g) **Description Truncation**
- Description limited to 2 lines with ellipsis
- Prevents cards from having inconsistent heights
- Encourages users to click "View Details" for full info

└─────────────────────┘
```

**Behavior:**
- **Logged-in users**: Click → Navigate to hike details
- **Non-logged-in users**: Click → Open login modal

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingPage.js`

### Dependencies Used
- `lucide-react` icons (Calendar, MapPin)
- Custom SVG icons (Clock, Location)
- React Router's `useNavigate` for navigation
- `useAuth` context for authentication state

### Conditional Rendering
- All new details check for data existence before rendering
- Prevents empty icons/labels if data not available
- Graceful degradation if backend doesn't provide certain fields

## User Experience Benefits
