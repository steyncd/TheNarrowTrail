- [ ] Test email verification flow

### Deploy Backend:
```bash
cd backend
# Option 1: Fix gcloud
gcloud run deploy hiking-portal-api --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated

# Option 2: Use Cloud Build
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/helloliam/hiking-portal-api
gcloud run deploy hiking-portal-api --image gcr.io/helloliam/hiking-portal-api
```

### Deploy Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Post-Deployment Testing:
- [ ] Register new user â†’ check email verification
