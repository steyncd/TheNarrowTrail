## ‚è≥ Pending Tasks

### 1. Run Database Migration (MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED)

**Option A: Using pgAdmin or Database Client**
1. Open pgAdmin or your PostgreSQL client
2. Connect to Cloud SQL database:
   - Host: 35.202.149.98
   - Database: hiking_portal
   - User: postgres
3. Open file: `backend/migrations/024_update_event_types.sql`
4. Execute the script

**Option B: Using PowerShell Script (If psql is installed)**
1. Locate your PostgreSQL psql.exe installation
2. Edit `backend/run-024-migration.ps1` line 6 with correct path
3. Run: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File backend\run-024-migration.ps1`

**Option C: Using Docker (If Docker is installed)**
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/backend/migrations:/migrations" \
  -e PGPASSWORD='!Dobby1021' \
  postgres:16 psql -h 35.202.149.98 -U postgres -d hiking_portal \
  -f /migrations/024_update_event_types.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Backend to Cloud Run

After running the database migration:

```bash
cd backend
gcloud run deploy backend \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --set-env-vars="NODE_ENV=production,DB_USER=postgres,DB_NAME=hiking_portal,DB_HOST=/cloudsql/helloliam:us-central1:hiking-db,DB_PORT=5432,FRONTEND_URL=https://www.thenarrowtrail.co.za"
```

### 3. Test Locally

1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Navigate to Events page (localhost:3000)
3. Click "Add Event"
4. Test each event type:
   - ‚úÖ Hiking - Should show Difficulty, Hike Type, Distance, Multi-day fields
   - ‚úÖ Camping - Should show SA-specific Camping Type, Facilities, etc.
   - ‚úÖ 4x4 - Should show Difficulty, Terrain, Vehicle Requirements
   - ‚úÖ **Cycling - Should show Ride Type, Difficulty, Distance, Elevation**
   - ‚úÖ Outdoor - Should show Activity Type, Difficulty, Duration
   - ‚ùå Fishing - Should NOT appear in event type selector

### 4. Deploy Frontend (After Testing)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `backend/migrations/024_update_event_types.sql` - Database migration
- `backend/run-024-migration.ps1` - PowerShell migration runner
- `frontend/src/components/events/eventTypes/CyclingFields.js` - Cycling fields component

### Modified Files:
- `frontend/src/components/hikes/AddHikeForm.js` - Form refactored with new structure
- `frontend/src/components/events/EventTypeSelector.js` - Updated icons (fishing‚Üícycling)
- `frontend/src/components/hikes/HikeCard.js` - Updated event type badges (fishing‚Üícycling)

### Previously Created (POC Phase):
- `frontend/src/components/events/eventTypes/HikingFields.js`
- `frontend/src/components/events/eventTypes/CampingFields.js`
- `frontend/src/components/events/eventTypes/FourWheelDriveFields.js`
- `frontend/src/components/events/eventTypes/OutdoorEventFields.js`

---

## üí° Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Run database migration 024 (see instructions above)
2. Deploy backend to Cloud Run
3. Hard refresh browser and test locally
4. Deploy frontend to Firebase Hosting

**After Deployment:**
1. Test creating events of all 5 types on production
2. Verify fishing is removed from event type selector
3. Verify cycling appears with blue bike icon
4. Verify event-specific fields work correctly
5. Test editing existing hiking events (should still work)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Backward Compatibility:** All existing hiking events will continue to work. Migration 023 already migrated existing data to the new structure.
- **Fishing Events:** If any fishing events exist, the migration will DEACTIVATE (not delete) the fishing event type as a safety measure.
- **Event Type Data:** All event-specific fields are stored in the `event_type_data` JSONB column, allowing flexible field structures per event type.
- **Frontend Compilation:** Currently compiling successfully with only ESLint warnings (no errors).
