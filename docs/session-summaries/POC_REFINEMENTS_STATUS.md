## What's Pending ❌

### High Priority - Form Restructuring:

1. **AddHikeForm.js - Major Refactoring**
   - Remove "Type" dropdown (day/multi) from common fields
   - Remove "Difficulty" dropdown from common fields
   - Update "Group Type" to only show Men/Family
   - Change "Hike Name" label to "Title"
   - Move location link, image URL, destination website to AFTER description (currently buried)
   - Import all new field components (HikingFields, FourWheelDriveFields, OutdoorEventFields)
   - Update conditional rendering:
     - `eventType === 'hiking'` → render HikingFields
     - `eventType === 'camping'` → render CampingFields (already done, but update validation)
     - `eventType === '4x4'` → render FourWheelDriveFields (new)
     - `eventType === 'outdoor'` → render OutdoorEventFields (new)
   - Update validation logic:
     - Hiking: require difficulty, hike_type
     - Camping: require camping_type
     - 4x4: require difficulty
     - Outdoor: require activity_type
   - Update handleSubmit to properly save event-specific data

2. **Database Migration**
   - Create migration 024 to remove fishing event type
   - Migrate any existing fishing events to 'outdoor' type

3. **Frontend - Remove Fishing**
   - EventTypeSelector.js: Remove Fish icon and fishing config
   - HikeCard.js: Remove fishing from EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG
   - Verify no other files reference fishing

4. **Testing All Changes**
   - Test creating each event type
   - Test editing each event type
   - Test validation works correctly
   - Test event type badges display correctly

## Estimated Time Remaining

- AddHikeForm refactoring: **2-3 hours** (complex, many changes)
- Database migration + backend: **30 minutes**
- Frontend fishing removal: **15 minutes**
- Testing all event types: **1 hour**
- **Total: 4-5 hours**

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Implementation (Recommended)
I can continue with the AddHikeForm refactoring and complete all pending tasks. This will take approximately 4-5 hours of work.

### Option 2: Test Current Components
You could test the individual components (Hiking Fields, 4x4 Fields, Outdoor Fields) in isolation to verify they work as expected before I integrate them into AddHikeForm.

### Option 3: Incremental Approach
I can complete one event type at a time:
1. First, complete Hiking (move difficulty/type to HikingFields)
2. Then complete 4x4 (integrate FourWheelDriveFields)
3. Then complete Outdoor (integrate OutdoorEventFields)
4. Finally, remove Fishing and deploy

## Questions for User

1. **Do you want me to continue with the complete refactoring now?**
2. **Or would you prefer to test what's been built so far first?**
3. **Any changes to the field requirements based on what's been implemented?**

---

**Current Status:** Frontend is running at http://localhost:3000 with all new components created but not yet integrated into AddHikeForm.
