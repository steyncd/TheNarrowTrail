## 🔐 Token Generation Guide

### For Home Assistant Users

**Step 1: Get a Long-Lived Token**

1. Log into https://helloliam.web.app
2. Click your name (top right) → **My Profile**
3. Scroll to **"Integration Tokens"** section
4. Click **"+ Generate Token"**
5. Enter a name (e.g., "Home Assistant")
6. Click **"Generate Token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you'll only see it once!)

**Step 2: Install Integration**

1. Copy `homeassistant/custom_components/hiking_portal/` to your Home Assistant
2. Place in: `/config/custom_components/hiking_portal/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

**Step 3: Configure**

1. **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **"+ Add Integration"**
3. Search for "hiking" or "The Narrow Trail"
4. Enter:
   - **API URL**: `https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app`
   - **Token**: [Paste your long-lived token]
5. Click **Submit**

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Integration not found"

**Symptoms:**
- Can't find "The Narrow Trail" when adding integration
- Search returns no results

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify files copied to correct location: `/config/custom_components/hiking_portal/`
2. ✅ Check all required files are present (see Files Structure above)
3. ✅ Restart Home Assistant after copying files
4. ✅ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. ✅ Check Home Assistant logs for errors

**Check logs:**
```
Settings → System → Logs
Search for: "hiking_portal" or "manifest"
```

---

### Issue 2: "Cannot connect to API"

**Symptoms:**
- Error during setup: "Cannot connect"
- Integration fails to validate

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify API URL is correct: `https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app`
2. ✅ NO trailing slash in API URL
3. ✅ Check Home Assistant has internet access
4. ✅ Test API manually:
   ```bash
   curl https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app/health
   ```

---

### Issue 3: "Invalid authentication"

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Invalid auth"
- Setup fails with 401 error

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Generate a NEW long-lived token from the portal
2. ✅ Ensure you copied the ENTIRE token (they're very long)
3. ✅ Check for spaces at beginning/end of token
4. ✅ Don't use a regular login token (they expire in 24 hours)
5. ✅ Verify token hasn't been revoked

**Test token manually:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app/api/hikes
```
Should return hike data (not 401 error).

---

### Issue 4: Sensors show "Unavailable"

**Symptoms:**
- All sensors show as "Unavailable"
- No data being fetched

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Check coordinator is running: Look for errors in logs
2. ✅ Verify token is still valid
3. ✅ Check internet connectivity from Home Assistant
4. ✅ Force refresh:
   - Developer Tools → States
   - Find sensor
   - Click refresh icon

**Enable debug logging:**
Add to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hiking_portal_v2: debug
```

---

### Issue 5: WebSocket not connecting

**Symptoms:**
- `binary_sensor.websocket_connected` is OFF
- `sensor.websocket_status` shows "disconnected"
- No real-time updates

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ WebSocket connection is optional - sensors will still work via polling
2. ✅ Check if backend supports WebSocket on the API URL
3. ✅ Verify firewall isn't blocking WebSocket connections
4. ✅ Check logs for WebSocket connection errors

**Note:** Real-time features work without WebSocket via 5-minute polling.

## 📋 Next Steps to Make It Work

### For You (The User)

**Option 1: Install in Your Home Assistant**
1. Copy the `hiking_portal` folder to your HA
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add integration with your token
4. Test and report any issues

**Option 2: Test Token Generation First**
1. Log into https://helloliam.web.app
2. Go to Profile
3. Look for "Integration Tokens" section
4. Try generating a token
5. If section doesn't exist, backend needs frontend update

### For Testing Backend

Run this command to test if token generation endpoint works:
```bash
# First, get a regular login token by logging into the portal
# Then test the endpoint:
curl -X POST https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app/api/tokens/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LOGIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Token"}'
```

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Commands

### Test Backend Endpoints
```bash
# Test health
curl https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app/health

# Test auth required endpoint (should get 401)
curl https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app/api/hikes

# Test with token (should get 200)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://backend-4kzqyywlqq-ew.a.run.app/api/hikes
```

### Check Integration in Home Assistant
```bash
# Check if integration is detected
ls /config/custom_components/hiking_portal/

# Check Home Assistant logs
tail -f /config/home-assistant.log | grep hiking_portal

# Check manifest
cat /config/custom_components/hiking_portal/manifest.json
```

## 📝 Summary

### What We Know Works ✅
1. Backend API is deployed and responding
2. Authentication endpoints are working
3. Long-lived token generation code exists
4. Integration code is complete and documented
5. All required endpoints are available

### What Needs Verification ⏳
1. Does the frontend have UI for generating tokens?
2. Does the integration actually load in Home Assistant?
3. Do sensors update correctly?
4. Does authentication work end-to-end?
5. Do services work when called?

### Likely Issues 🔍
1. **Frontend token UI** - May not be implemented yet
2. **First-time setup** - Config flow might have bugs
3. **Domain name** - Using `hiking_portal_v2` might need to match exactly
4. **Coordinator updates** - Might have timing issues

### Recommended First Test 🎯
1. Try accessing https://helloliam.web.app/profile
2. Look for "Integration Tokens" section
3. If it exists → Generate token → Test integration
4. If it doesn't exist → Frontend needs update first

---

**Status:** Integration is code-complete but needs real-world testing in Home Assistant
**Blocker:** May need to verify/implement frontend token generation UI
**Next Step:** User should attempt installation and report specific error messages
