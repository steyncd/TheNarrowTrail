## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Loading
1. Check Home Assistant logs for errors
2. Ensure all files are in the correct directory
3. Verify your long-lived token is still valid
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Sensors Showing "Unknown"
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the backend API is accessible
3. Check the integration configuration
4. Look for API errors in the logs

### Dashboard Not Working
1. Ensure all entities exist and are working
2. Check for YAML syntax errors
3. Verify card types are supported in your HA version
4. Test individual cards before combining

### Services Not Available
1. Restart Home Assistant after installation
2. Check that the integration loaded successfully
3. Verify service schemas in the logs
4. Test with simple service calls first

## Configuration Options

The integration supports these configuration options in the UI:

- **Base URL**: Your Hiking Portal backend URL
- **Token**: Long-lived authentication token
- **Update Interval**: How often to fetch data (default: 300 seconds)

## API Endpoint Requirements

The enhanced integration requires these additional backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications
- `POST /api/notifications/{id}/read` - Mark notification as read
- `GET /api/payments/outstanding` - Get outstanding payments
- `POST /api/payments` - Record payment
- `GET /api/weather/hike/{id}` - Get weather for hike
- `GET /api/weather/alerts` - Get weather alerts

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Home Assistant logs
2. Verify your backend API is running and accessible
3. Test API endpoints manually with your token
4. Check the GitHub repository for updates

The integration provides detailed logging - enable debug logging for the `hiking_portal` component to see detailed API communication.
