# Quick Start Guide - Test Your Home Assistant Integration

## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd c:\hiking-portal\backend
npm install ical-generator axios
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend (Optional - only if testing calendar/webhooks)

The sensors will work with your existing deployed backend. The calendar endpoints are new, so you'll need to deploy if you want calendar functionality.

```bash
# Backend is already updated in server.js
# Just redeploy when ready
```

### Step 3: Copy Integration to Home Assistant

Copy the entire folder:
```
c:\hiking-portal\homeassistant\custom_components\hiking_portal\
```

To your Home Assistant:
```
/config/custom_components/hiking_portal/
```

**File Checklist:**
- [ ] `__init__.py`
- [ ] `calendar.py`
- [ ] `config_flow.py`
- [ ] `const.py`
- [ ] `coordinator.py`
- [ ] `manifest.json`
- [ ] `sensor.py`
- [ ] `strings.json`
- [ ] `translations/en.json`

### Step 4: Get Your JWT Token

**Quick Method (Browser):**

1. Open https://helloliam.web.app
2. Log in with your account
3. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
4. Go to **Application** tab
5. In the left sidebar: **Local Storage** > `https://helloliam.web.app`
6. Find the row with key: `token`
7. Copy the entire value (it's long!)

Example token format:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwibmFtZSI6Ikpv...
```

### Step 5: Restart Home Assistant

- **Settings** > **System** > **Restart**
- Wait ~1 minute for restart

### Step 6: Add Integration

1. **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration** (bottom right)
3. Type "hiking" or "narrow trail"
4. Click **The Narrow Trail Hiking Portal**
5. Enter:
   - **API URL**: `https://hiking-portal-api-554106646136.us-central1.run.app`
   - **Token**: [Paste your JWT token]
6. Click **Submit**

âœ… You should see: "Successfully configured The Narrow Trail Hiking Portal"

### Step 7: Verify It's Working

#### Check Sensors

1. Go to **Developer Tools** > **States**
2. Search for "hiking" or "sensor.next"
3. You should see:
   - `sensor.next_hike` - Should show your next hike name (or "No upcoming hikes")
   - `sensor.my_hikes_count` - Should show a number
   - `sensor.upcoming_hikes_count` - Should show a number
   - `sensor.pending_users` - Number (or 0 if not admin)
   - `sensor.total_hikes` - Total number of hikes

#### Check Calendar

1. Click **Calendar** in the sidebar
2. Look for "Hiking Portal Events" in the list
3. Click on it to see your hikes displayed

#### Add to Dashboard

1. Go to **Overview** (your main dashboard)
2. Click **Edit Dashboard** (top right)
3. Click **+ Add Card**
4. Select **Entities**
5. Click **+ Add Entity**
6. Search for "hiking"
7. Add these sensors:
   - Next Hike
   - My Hikes Count
   - Upcoming Hikes Count
8. Click **Save**

You should now see a card showing your hiking information!

## Testing Each Feature

### Test 1: Sensor Updates

1. In Home Assistant, note the values of your sensors
2. In the hiking portal, express interest in a new hike
3. Wait 5 minutes (or force update):
   - **Developer Tools** > **States**
   - Find `sensor.my_hikes_count`
   - Click the refresh icon
4. The count should increase!

### Test 2: Calendar Events

1. Go to **Calendar**
2. Find "Hiking Portal Events"
3. Click on a hike event
4. You should see:
   - Hike name
   - Date and time
   - Description with details
   - Location

### Test 3: Admin Features (If you're admin)

1. Check `sensor.pending_users`
2. If it's > 0, you can see pending user details in sensor attributes:
   - **Developer Tools** > **States**
   - Find `sensor.pending_users`
   - Click on it
   - Scroll to **Attributes**
   - You'll see user names, emails, etc.

### Test 4: Automation (Optional)

Create a simple automation:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Test Hike Notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.next_hike
    action:
      - service: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          title: "Next Hike Changed"
          message: "Your next hike is now: {{ states('sensor.next_hike') }}"
```

Now change your hike interests in the portal and watch for the notification!

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "Integration not found"
- Make sure you restarted Home Assistant after copying files
- Check the folder structure is correct
- Look in logs: **Settings** > **System** > **Logs** (search for "hiking")

### "Cannot connect to API"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API URL has no trailing slash
- Test in browser: Visit the API URL - should show JSON

### "Invalid authentication"
- Token might be expired - get a new one
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE token
- Check for extra spaces at beginning/end

### "Sensors show unavailable"
- Check the coordinator update succeeded
- Look at attributes of a sensor - any error messages?
- Force update: Developer Tools > States > Sensor > Refresh icon

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hiking_portal: debug
```

Restart and check logs for detailed information.
